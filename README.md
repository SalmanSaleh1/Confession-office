# Confession Office

**Confession Office** is a web application where users can anonymously share their thoughts and confessions. This is my second website project, following the **Calculator Website**. The project leverages PHP, MySQL, and HTML/CSS for the frontend and backend development.

## Description

Confession Office is a platform for users to anonymously share their thoughts, confessions, and reflections. It provides a safe space for people to express themselves without fear of judgment or repercussions. The website allows users to submit their confessions, which are then displayed anonymously for others to read. Users can also interact with posts by liking or commenting on them, fostering a sense of community and connection among users.
